<!-- 
    This template is for the Search Results page of the website. It extends the base.html template,
    and fills in the 'content' block.

    The 'content' block includes a heading for the page and a check to see if there are any character results from the user's search. If there are, a grid layout is used to display each character's information.

    Each character is represented with a card that includes an image, the character's name, and a 
    button that links to a more detailed page for that character. The character is only displayed 
    if it is a mapping (i.e., a dictionary-like object, which is what we expect a character to be).

    If there are no search results, a message indicating this is displayed.
